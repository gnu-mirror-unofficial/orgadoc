GNU OrgaDoc Installation Guide

You will need the following mandatory programs:
    
	* libxml2-dev

The below are optional programs but which generate the documentation:
    
	* docbook-utils
	* texinfo

On Trisquel GNU/Linux you need to run "sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev docbook-utils texinfo". For other distributions, you will need to use their package managers. However the names of the libraries should be the same.

Compiling and Installation:

	* type 'make' and you will get a GNU OrgaDoc binary 'orgadoc' in the root directory (../src).

To install GNU OrgaDoc onto your system, type 'sudo make install' which will compile and install the program. The path to the config file is '~/.orgadoc.conf'.

For an in-depth usage of GNU OrgaDoc, please read the documentation generated from 'docs/orgadoc.texi'.
